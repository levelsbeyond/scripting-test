"Moving parts in rubbing contact require lubrication to avoid
 excessive wear. Honorifics and formal politeness provide the
 lubrication where people rub together. Often the very young,
 the untraveled, the naive, the unsophisticated deplore these
 formalities as "empty," "meaningless," or "dishonest," and
 scorn to use them. No matter how "pure" their motives, they
 thereby throw sand into machinery that does not work too well
 at best." -- Robert A. Heinlein
